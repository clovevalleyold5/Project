## Intro

With the technology develops at increasing pace everyday, the Internet is becoming more and more inseparable from out daily life. From waking up check the weather and commute, to deciding what to eat for dinner, everywhere we go, every decision we make, is depends on the information we obtained from the Internet. After I graduate from school, I joined the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman, and I worked at Deployment Health Department at Naval Health Clinic Quantico for the past four years, and my job is to maintain military personnel's medical readiness across the base, to make sure that one is always ready to be deployed. One key factor that determines whether a marine or a sailor is fully medical ready or not heavily depends on their Periodic Health Assessment, which is due annually. In the past, in order to complete a PHA, military personnel need to go to the clinic to pick up the paper work and to be screened. On the screening paperwork, it lists the items which that one needs to complete before they can schedule an appointment with the provider. Since 2018 January, Navy Medicine launched electronic PHA questionnaire which enables the personnel to complete their questionnaires online; however, even though that personnel can start the PHA process before they go to the clinic, they are still required to be screened by the medical staff, who will go to the Medical Readiness and Reporting System (MRRS) to see what delinquent items one may has. The MRRS website allows the medical staff to input the personnel's data, and then pull out their record to see and edit personnel's medical information, such as demographic information, lab results, vaccines history, dentals status, etc. You can say that MRRS acts as an online medical record system, but has an ancient UI and very limited access.

I'd like to compare MRRS with a few other websites I use on a daily basis and see what we can propose to improve its functionality.

1. #### Google

   If you have a question, you Google it, and Google gives you answers. As the most powerful search engine, Google has more than 3.5 billion searches each day. Google allows us to type our questions as a string and search its database for the related results and display it as links which takes us to the website that may contain the best answer. In the past, google only allows you to search in words, but now you can also search by voice and uploaded images. In order to do so, Google's database is the key. It requires database maintenance, data analysis, even multi-platform connectivity.

2. #### Outlook

   There are many email service like yahoo and Gmail, the one I use is Microsoft Outlook. In order to use it, registration is required for an email account first. When writing an email, it is just like writing a letter, you write in text, and you can attach files into this email. You can also invite someone into a calendar event, manage your contact.

3. #### OneDrive

   OneDrive, once called SkyDrive, is a file hosting service and synchronization service operated by Microsoft Cloud as part of its web version of Office. Basically, it is like an external drive that connects to your computer as long as you are connected. You can upload files into your OneDrive, and you can share the files you like to someone who you grant them accesses.

## Conclusion

Would it be nice if we can modify MRRS by adding it to Outlook? We don't necessarily to allow someone to edit their record, but at least by letting them see what will be due or when will be due can help a lot with PHA booking process. For instance, if someone needs to complete a fasting glucose test. A medical staff will send a calendar event to the person and generate a lab order, and when the lab is complete, this person will be removed from the hit list.
